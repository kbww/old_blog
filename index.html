							<h2 style="text-align:center">Missing pieces in Machine Intelligence</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The idea of machines that operate on the principles of the human brain has been around for more than fifty years.  So, the Machine Learning approaches we have are based on the understanding of how the brain works and how it solves problems. We cannot just mimic one area of brain to achieve almost Human level Intelligence.</p>
						<p>For example, we cannot only focus on the cerebral cortex which contains the Neocortex responsible for higher functions such as sensory perception, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning, conscious thought, and in humans, language, and at the same time we are skipping the limbic system which has the Hippocampus- center of emotion, memory, and the autonomic nervous system.</p>

						<p>So, to achieve more in Machine Intelligence, we have to completely simulate the Human Brain with extreme flexibility. The two areas of brain Neocortex and Hippocampus must be the main benchmark for Machine Learning, and at Brainiac we are doing something similar. Humans can learn to do new things and solve new types of problems no matter what complexity, on a vast level. To build intelligent machines with equal flexibility, we need to understand the fundamental principles, our brain uses to achieve this remarkable ability.</p>

						<p>So, our approach to solve intelligence is Unique. Because we are going deep into the Human Brain, the way it learns and adopts to new things and then we want to put those abilities into the Machine Software. And we believe that focus on flexibility, learning from the brain is the path to Machine Intelligence.</p><br>

							<h2 style="text-align:center">Artificial Intelligence - The revolution began before you even realized it.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Imagine taking a time machine back to 70’s - A time when the world was in a permanent power outage, long-distance communication meant either yelling loudly or firing a cannon in the air, and all transportation ran on hay. When you get there, you retrieve a dude, bring him to 2015, and then walk him around and watch him react to everything. It’s impossible for us to understand what it would be like for him to see shiny capsules racing by on a highway, talk to people who had been on the other side of the ocean earlier in the day, watch sports that were being played 1,000 miles away, hear a musical performance that happened 50 years ago, and play with my magical wizard rectangle that he could use to capture a real-life image or record a living moment, generate a map with a paranormal moving blue dot that shows him where he is, look at someone’s face and chat with them even though they’re on the other side of the country, and worlds of other inconceivable sorcery. This is all before you show him the internet or explain things like the International Space Station, the Large Hadron Collider, nuclear weapons, or general relativity and much more. Not only this, take a second to think about the Smartphone in your pocket. When you were born, the idea of such a small, powerful computer was a sci-fi dream — and now these devices are everywhere, transforming personal health, relationships and business transactions so completely that life without them seems impossible. We’re entering a new era of technology that’s bound to shape the lives of our children more substantially. Yes this is the era of Artificial Intelligence.</p>

						<p>So what’s Artificial Intelligence? Many people have defined Artificial Intelligence a different way. Here’s what I think AI is:</p>

						<p><i>“The capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior”</i></p>

						 <p>Some of you may have watched the Movies like Artificial Intelligence, Transformer and IRobot.</p>

						<p>There seems to be a war-like philosophy – if we develop them, they will overtake us, putting our very existence in danger. Robots will take over the world, and we will lose control. Yes, it might be true to some extent as we may lose many jobs which we have today, like manufacturing and assembling. Manufacturing will be the next industry to be transformed. Robots have, for many years, been able to perform surgery, milk cows, do military reconnaissance and combat, and assemble goods. But they weren’t dexterous enough to do the type of work that humans do in installing circuit boards.</p>

						<p>Also, we all are carrying a Robot in our pockets. Yes, I’m talking about your Smartphone. On our mobile phones, too, we see Artificial Intelligence in action. Intelligent personal assistants such as Google Now in Android phones, Siri in Apple phones and Cortana in Microsoft Windows phones can take a stream of speech, interpret it and offer solutions by individualizing responses and delegating to other applications to complete tasks. While these applications of Artificial Intelligence have been widely accepted, other developments are causing more of a mixed reaction. Driverless cars are hitting the headlines and grabbing the attention of everyone. While advocates try to reassure people that removing human error can make driving safer, skeptics are terrified by the prospect of cars "driving themselves" around our cities and countryside. Can a car be programmed to act more safely than a driver would, to take into account the magnitude of variables including other humans' behavior, weather and the environment? Science says yes, but this is a concept that many humans find difficult to accept.</p>

						<p>We have been already warned about Artificial Intelligence by some bright minds in the technological industry like Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk. So, shall we fear or imagine a freedom?</p>

						<p>For many people, the prospect does not sit comfortably. Concerns range from the immediate to the apocalyptic. If machines take over all our jobs, how will we earn money? What if machines develop so much that they overthrow the human race, Terminator-style?</p>

						 <p>I cannot help but think this is an extremely short-sighted view. The reality of Artificial Intelligence integrating our everyday lives in this way is hundreds of years away, and the landscape in this imagined future will be very different from the world we enjoy now. So what if we turn the question on its head? If robots are going to be doing all the work for us, performing all the tasks that look after the economy and drive through innovation, what else could us humans be doing? Why do we fear a time where we are not tied to a computer screen or breaking our backs with manual labor, and instead have time to experience the wonders of the world we live in? Can anyone who owns a dishwasher really say that they miss the time they used to spend washing dishes? Do car owners long for a horse and cart to make the 30 mile commute to work every day?</p>

						 <p>Or maybe we could spend our time putting right the wrongs that our generation and the ones before it have made. It seems bizarre that in a time when our news headlines are full of the extremities of war and the impact this has on human life, as we sit in our offices reading about families fleeing for their lives and putting themselves in extreme danger because of the actions of other humans, that we fear our species’ risk is from mechanical devices rather than people. As a race we have the opportunity to nurture the growth of Artificial Intelligence, such as a parent does with a child, to create a future where both can co-exist. If we get this right, our robots will enrich, rather than endanger, our lives.</p>

						 <p>We have to adapt ourselves as human beings to the constraints of computers. Recently, a computer program developed on the foundation of Artificial Intelligence by Google DeepMind has defeated the World GO champion. GO is an ancient Chinese game which has complexity more than Chess has. But, this is just an accomplishment and not everything about Artificial Intelligence.</p>

						 <p>Artificial Intelligence is also a great field to pursue your career. IT companies have gone for native programming companies to fully Artificial Intelligence based companies. Like Facebook, Google, Twitter, Microsoft and the list of names goes on.</p><br>

							 <h2 style="text-align:center">The Real Programmers</h2>
						 </header>
						 <p><i>Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.”</i><br>
						<i>– Rich Cook</i></p>

						<p>Computer Programming is an art of making machines to take decisions and solve a particular problem and this task is done by a genius who is known as a Programmer. So, who really are these Programmers?</p>

						<p>Software is eating the world and there is a race between Corporations in making cool stuff. Behind all these cool things are working some humans day and night making sure that a bad key config won't bankrupt the entire corporation. These are known as software engineers. So, what is it like to be a Software Engineer? Well, people say all you need is to have a knowledge of programming languages and software development cycles.</p>

						<p>But, is this enough to call yourself a Software Engineer or a  Developer or a Programmer. Nope! You're a Software Engineer or whatever if you've strong logical skills and  great hold on Mathematics, Data Structures, Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence. It doesn't stop here. Now, man can you even code anything?</p>

						<p>In a recent blog post by Santiago L. Valdarrama, says that everyone who calls himself a Software Engineer must be able to solve these  5 problems in less than an hour. If you can't then you need to stop calling yourself a Software Engineer.</p>

						<p>Now-days, people build mobile apps, websites but fail to solve the real problems. anyone can remember the API's and then reuse them and create website using HTML, CSS and whatever they know. But, where is the logical ability. You need to back and start again from the they day you jumped to development. Don't be ashamed but you need this.</p>

						<p>Building websites and writing mobile apps won't make you a Programmer and stop this nonsense here right now. You're freaking out when you're told to fix a bug of what you just built.</p>

						<p>The 5 problems:</p>

						<p>(The following problems are ridiculously simple, but you'd be surprise to discover how many people struggle with them. To the point of not getting anything done at all. Seriously.)</p>

						<p><b>Problem 1</b></p>

						<p>Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion.</p>

						<p><b>Problem 2</b></p>

						<p>Write a function that combines two lists by alternatively taking elements. For example: given the two lists [a, b, c] and [1, 2, 3], the function should return [a, 1, b, 2, c, 3].</p>

						<p><b>Problem 3</b></p>

						<p>Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As an example, here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.</p>

						<p><b>Problem 4</b></p>

						<p>Write a function that given a list of non negative integers, arranges them such that they form the largest possible number. For example, given [50, 2, 1, 9], the largest formed number is 95021.</p>

						<p><b>Problem 5</b></p>

						<p>Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put or or nothing between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result is always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100.</p>

							<h2 style="text-align:center">Mathematics, Algorithms and Programming</h2>
						</header>
						<p>All the human activity and the activities of other objects in this Universe is Mathematics. From morning to evening a person does a lots of Mathematics in his daily life.</p>

						<p>Similarly, Mathematics is the thing which is directly concerned with writing feature rich algorithms and hence amazing computer programs, that do things in less time.</p>

						<p>When writing Algorithms if we put the emphasis on abstraction of the problem then Mathematics is the tool you'll definitely need, which will give you the ability to strip away all the unnecessary stuff and focus on the important properties. So, where actually do we really use Mathematics in solving problems using Algorithms and transforming in the computer code? Some of the applications are Data Compression, Computer Graphics, Modelling and Simulation, etc. The recent application of Mathematics has rapidly increased in the field of Data Science -  where we can use the Mathematical functions to manipulate and study the changes in the data, we call it Big Data.</p>

						<p>Now, let us take Calculus as our example of the context. We've all worked with the Divide and Conquer Algorithmic strategy which breaks down a large problem into small sub problems and then we sum up all the solutions of the sub problems and conclude with the whole problem solution. The division of problem depends upon the size of problem. So, in this case if we use the Differentiation and divide the same problem, think for a moment how fast it can be. This is really amazing.</p>

						<p>Also, computing Time and Space Complexity of an Algorithm can also be done using some Mathematical functions such as Increasing and Decreasing functions. We can also take Domain and Range of a function as the Input and Output of the Algorithm, respectively.</p>

						<p>So, if we want better Software, Apps and Websites we need mathematics  as a part of the family.</p>

							<h2 style="text-align:center">Avoiding Project Failure</h2>
						</header>
						<p><i>"A project is considered a failure when it has not delivered what was required, in line with expectations."</i></p>

						<p>Some of us may have gone through times when our projects fail before they're delivered to clients. The possible cases when a failure occur are,</p>

						<p><ul>
						<li>Poor planning.</li>
						<li>Poor implementation.</li>
						<li>Wrong business requirements.</li>
						<li>Environmental changes.</li>
						<li>People lose interest in the project.</li>
						<li>and so on.</li></ul></p>

						<p>Apart from these there are other number of cases which affect the project governance like skipping the initial phases like planning and other decision making strategies. Some of us may may have failed on projects because we started to build the projects without a proper plan. We started to work and we didn't knew where it will lead us and what issues might appear.</p>

						<p>Sometime ago, when i was in college and we were given our college projects to work on. I was told that I've to write an Image editing software for Windows Mobile devices. I sat down figured out the features which I've to include in my project and next day I started writing code for the project. I kept writing cod for next 2 days and I got trapped because of some feature which the programming language I was using, was not supported. So, all the development process was halted and I had to re-plan the project and start with something else. As, I was new to work on products at scale it was hard for me figure out the issue. So, then I started analyzing my previous project plan and figure out the possible case for the failure. The cause was I started working without properly knowing about the programming language I was using, I hadn't done a support check with the language and so, the result. This is a not a common case of project failure, I was trying to make you understand how projects fail. Now, you might be thinking that I am crazy that I went to Programming. Yeah! Well! I think so. Wait! I'm kidding, I love programming as much as I love to eat.</p>

						<p>So, if you want to make your project a success, you need make a list of all the scenarios where a project might fail. Some of them I mentioned at start and there are other scenarios too, you need to consider before working on the project. Remember "Proper planning leads to best results".</p>

						<p>A project is said to be success when it delivers to cost, on time and to quality.</p>

						<p><i>Productivity is never an accident. It is always the result of a commitment to excellence, intelligent planning, and focused effort.</i><br>

							<h2 style="text-align:center">Programming - The Magic</h2>
						</header>
						<p>When people ask me about why I chose to became a Programmer, I give them one answer - Programming is magic.</p>

						<p>Now, people don't get what I meant by saying Programming is magic. If one has these great skills, they can solve a bunch of very much complex problems which a decade ago was not possible. So, here the magic comes, to solve these much complex problems.</p>

						<p>But the reality is Programmers don't like this magic, because in the context of programming languages magic is referred to code which is wrote intended to do something and ends up doing else. These people have some kind of love and hate relationship with this magic because sometimes it's hard to figure out own errors in the magic. Well that was a funny part.</p>

						<p>Let's take a simple example of a problem solved by this magic - Mobile Apps. Yo! There are billions of amazing mobile apps developed by Fantastic Engineers which have helped us to get the world at our finger tips and simplified the way we used to live. These are the magicians and this programming is their tool. We have great mobile apps some of them are which we use daily like - Free messaging apps, Office apps, email apps, health, food and fitness apps, etc. These apps have changes our living ways, it feels like the world on a click.</p>

						<p>Initially these magic guys where tool oriented which depended on the tools the used to become the wizards, but the trend has changed now. Present magicians are language oriented which means no matter what the tools they have but they use some powerful language which can do everything possible for them in more efficient way.</p>

						<p>So, if you've these amazing skills then put your little effort and be the part of this great Magical world of amazing people.</p>

						<p>If you don't have a career to choose, then I recommend you to learn these skills and see how it amazes you. Well it has amazed me when I got the first computer at home late back in school. I was curious to learn how this box does all the magic and which led me to choose Programming as my career.</p><br>
